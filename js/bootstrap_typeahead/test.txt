How to use?
===========

This should be setup before rendering a page. See `fanstatic`_ for more
information::

  >>> from fanstatic import init_needed
  >>> needed = init_needed(base_url='http://localhost')

You can import ajax_typeahead from ``js.bootstrap_typeahead`` and ``.need`` it
where you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.bootstrap_typeahead import ajax_typeahead
  >>> ajax_typeahead.need()
